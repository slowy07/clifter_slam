# clifter slam

clifter_slam is an open-source library aimed at providing implementation of SLAM subsystem for deeplearning (DL) practioners. While several DL practitioners want to use SLAM from the comfort of theri favorite DL library (TensorFlow / Pytorch), there are currentyl no freely available implementations.We aim to fill in that gap with this library

Another underlying motivation is to release code for the clifter_slam paper, where we demonstrate end-to-end differentiable dense SLAM systems. People should be able to load up their favorite datasets and run differentiable / no-differentiable dense SLAM system on them
